My name is Alexander Kvartalny. I'm a spoken translator based in Kiev, Ukraine.\
\
I interpret across English, Russian and Ukrainian at private and public events, including meetings, negotiations, conferences, seminars, audits, presentations, business trips and others.\
\
I've helped businesses make deals and find local partners. I have interpreted speakers at various events. I've assisted companies, NGOs, universities, and researchers at interviews.\
\
I do remote interpretation (RSI) via zoom and other applications. Because these applications make it possible to "hide" the interpreter, it feels as if your contact is simply speaking your language.\
\
I can also help you with translating the presentation or documents you need for your event.
